                            Through this class, I learned the basics of OOP, Java programming, basic data structures, abstract data types, and more basics of programming.
                            While it wasn't the most difficult course, it did help prepare me to be a better programmer, and instilled some best coding practices I still use today.

                            As a direct succeeding course to CS 300, this course focused on advanced data structures, and basic algorithms.
                            On top of the higher level programming concepts that this course taught through Java, we also learned a multitude of other programming languages and technologies.
                            These include HTML, CSS, Bash, Git, and more.
                            This course also had a focus on learning the fundamentals of group programming through the use of 4 person group projects.
                            Overall, this course was a great experience and taught a lot of the more difficult fundamentals.

                            This class was focused on the low-level physical components of the LC-3 computer, as well programming in LC-3 assembly.
                            Overall, helped me learn how low-level programs are executed and allows me to this day to think of new and more efficient ways to program.

                            This course was the next course after CS 252 where we focused on one level of abstraction above assembly.
                            The programming was all done in C, and a little bit of 32-bit x86 Windows Assembly.
                            After taking CS 252 and now working on a low-level programming language, this class gave me a whole new appreciation and insight into the power and drawbacks of high-level languages.

                            Through this course I learned many paradigms for creating efficient algorithms.

                            Through this course I got the opportunity to teach sixteen 2nd graders the basic principles of Computer Science through Scratch Programming.
                            I loved taking this class as it reminded me of the classes I took as a kid that got me interested in Computer Science.
                            This class is focused on giving back to the community and helping out new students who are starting to enjoy working with technology in our every digitized world.

                            It was an interesting Math class, but it was very labourous, and took a while to master.
                            Linear Algebra, RREF, and Matricies will forever be engrained in my memory

                            While the class was difficult, it was my first Math Class as well as my first lecture at College.
                            Overall, the class was made a lot easier after I put time into learning the concepts.

                            The need to problem solve and conceptualize the math problems was one of the most unique math experiences I had up until that point.

                            As a precursor to Analysis 1 (Math 521), this class is just as advertised.
                            The class was tedious as you were just writing proofs, and while the homeworks were only 3-4 questions a week, sometimes it would take an hour or two just to conceptualize one problem.
                            While sometimes the class was a bit difficult it was overall a great course that encourages collaboration and working with peers.
